  abstract  = "This paper develops, calibrates, and simulates a dynamic
               88-period OLG model to study the intergenerational transmission
               of U.S. wealth inequality via bequests. The model features
               marriage, realistic fertility patterns, random death,
               assortative mating based on skills, heterogeneous skill
               endowments, heterogeneous rates of return, skill inheritability,
               progressive income taxation, and resource annuitization via
               social security. All bequests arise from imperfect
               annuitization. Nonetheless, the model generates a realistic
               ratio of aggregate wealth to aggregate labor income, a realistic
               bequest flow relative to the stock of wealth, and a realistic
               wealth distribution at retirement. Skill differences,
               assortative mating, social security, and the time preference are
               the primary determinants of wealth inequality. Bequests do
               propagate wealth inequality, but only in the presence of social
               security, which disproportionately disinherits the lifetime
               poor. Intergenerational wealth immobility, also considered here,
               is primarily determined by the inheritance of skills from one's
               parents and the magnification of the impact of this inheritance
               by marital sorting.",

  abstract  = "This paper develops a theory of optimal capital taxation that
               expresses optimal tax formulas in sufficient statistics. We
               first consider a simple model with utility functions linear in
               consumption and featuring heterogeneous utility for wealth. In
               this case, there are no transitional dynamics, the steady-state
               is reached immediately and has finite elasticities of capital
               with respect to the net-of-tax rate. This allows for a tractable
               optimal tax analysis with formulas expressed in terms of
               empirical elasticities and social preferences that can address
               many important policy questions. These formulas can easily be
               taken to the data to simulate optimal taxes, which we do using
               U.S. tax return data on labor and capital incomes. Second, we
               show how these results can be extended to the case with concave
               utility for consumption. The same types of formulas carry over
               by appropriately defining elasticities. We show that one can
               recover all the results from the simpler model using a new and
               non standard steady state approach that respects individual
               preferences even with a fully general utility function.",

               introduce wealth into the utility function; the justification is
               that wealth is a marker of social status, and people value
               status. Since people partly save to accrue social status, the
               Euler equation is modified. As a result, when the marginal
               utility of wealth is sufficiently large, the dynamical system
               representing the zero-lower-bound equilibrium transforms from a
               saddle to a source, which resolves all the anomalies.",

@ARTICLE{Dynan2004-bu,
  title     = "{Do the Rich Save More?}",
  author    = "Dynan, Karen e and Skinner, Jonathan and Zeldes, Stephen p",
  abstract  = "The question of whether higher--lifetime income households save
               a larger fraction of their income was the subject of much debate
               in the 1950s and 1960s, and while not resolved, it remains
               central to the evaluation of tax and macroeconomic policies. We
               resolve this long‐standing question using new empirical methods
               applied to the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, the Survey of
               Consumer Finances, and the Consumer Expenditure Survey. We find
               a strong positive relationship between saving rates and lifetime
               income and a weaker but still positive relationship between the
               marginal propensity to save and lifetime income. There is little
               support for theories that seek to explain these positive
               correlations by relying solely on time preference rates,
               nonhomothetic preferences, or variations in Social Security
               benefits. There is more support for models emphasizing
               uncertainty with respect to income and health expenses, bequest
               motives, and asset‐based means testing or behavioral factors

               accumulation: A new answer}",
  author    = "Dynan, Karen E and Skinner, Jonathan and Zeldes, Stephen P",
  abstract  = "As the workhorse of consumption and saving research for the past
               four decades, the life-cycle model has proved flexible and
               useful for examining a variety of questions. In a classic paper,
               Albert Ando and Franco Modigliani (1963 p. 56) stated a key
               assumption of the basic model: ``[t]he individual neither
               expects to receive nor desires to leave any inheritance.''
               Although the authors contended that the absence of a bequest
               motive was not critical to the heart of their results, the
               assumption set off a long-standing battle over the relative
               importance of different motives for saving. In an influential
               study, Laurence Kotlikoff and Laurence Summers (1981) estimated
               that a large fraction of the U.S. capital stock was attributable
               to intergenerational transfers. Modigliani and his collaborators
               vigorously disagreed and, based on their own empirical work,
               claimed that life-cycle saving was the primary source of capital
               accumulation (Modigliani, 1988). Subsequent work has failed to
               reach a consensus. Since this debate began, an important advance
               in the consumption literature has been the incorporation of
               uncertainty in life-cycle models (see e.g., R. Glenn Hubbard et
               al., 1995). We argue that allowing for uncertainty resolves the
               controversy over the importance of life-cycle and bequest saving
               by showing that these motives for saving are overlapping and
               cannot generally be distinguished. A dollar saved today
               simultaneously serves both a precautionary life-cycle function
               (guarding against future contingencies such as health shocks or
               other emergencies) and a bequest function because, in the likely
               event that the dollar is not absorbed by these contingencies, it
               will be available to bequeath to children or other worthy
               causes. Under this view, households have a bequest motive, but
               bequests are given (i.e., the motive is ``operative'') in only
               some states of the world. Wealth is something like traveler's
               checks: you take them along on vacation ``just in case,'' but
               odds are they will remain uncashed and available for sundry
               goods after the journey is complete. We first demonstrate the
               result using a simple model and then argue that this approach
               reconciles the apparent importance of bequests with households'
               declared focus on life-cycle saving. Finally, we consider
               implications of our analysis.",

              new theory of wealth inequality that merges two empirically
              relevant forces generating inequality: bequest motives and
              inheritance of ability across generations; and an earnings
              process that allows for more earnings risk for the richest.
              Second, it uses the resulting calibrated framework to study the
              effects of changing estate taxation. Increasing the estate tax
              reduces the wealth concentration in the hands of the richest few
              and the economic advantage of being born to a rich and super-rich
              family at the cost of reduced aggregate capital and output.
              However, all of these effects are quite small. In contrast,
              increasing estate taxation can generate a significant welfare
              gain to a newborn under the veil of ignorance, but this comes at
              a large welfare cost for the super-rich.",

  abstract    = "This paper considers several alternative explanations for the
                 fact that households with higher levels of lifetime income (
                 the rich') have higher lifetime saving rates (Dynan, Skinner,
                 and Zeldes (1996); Lillard and Karoly (1997)). The paper
                 argues that the saving behavior of the richest households
                 cannot be explained by models in which the only purpose of
                 wealth accumulation is to finance future consumption, either
                 their own or that of heirs. The paper concludes that the
                 simplest model that explains the relevant facts is one in
                 which either consumers regard the accumulation of wealth as an
                 end in itself, or unspent wealth yields a flow of services
                 (such as power or social status) which have the same practical
                 effect on behavior as if wealth were intrinsically desirable.",

  abstract  = "This paper constructs and calibrates a parsimonious model of
               occupational choice that allows for entrepreneurial entry, exit,
               and investment decisions in the presence of borrowing
               constraints. The model fits very well a number of empirical
               observations, including the observed wealth distribution for
               entrepreneurs and workers. At the aggregate level, more
               restrictive borrowing constraints generate less wealth
               concentration and reduce average firm size, aggregate capital,
               and the fraction of entrepreneurs. Voluntary bequests allow some
               high?ability workers to establish or enlarge an entrepreneurial
               activity. With accidental bequests only, there would be fewer
               very large firms and less aggregate capital and wealth
               concentration.",

  abstract  = "[This article constructs and simulates a life cycle model of
               wealth accumulation and estimates the parameters of the utility
               function (the rate of time preference and the coefficient of
               risk aversion) by matching the simulated median wealth profiles
               with those observed in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and in
               the Survey of Consumer Finances. The estimates imply a low

               results are used to study the importance of precautionary
               savings in explaining wealth accumulation. They imply that
               wealth accumulation is driven mostly by precautionary motives at
               the beginning of the life cycle, whereas savings for retirement
               purposes become significant only closer to retirement.]",
