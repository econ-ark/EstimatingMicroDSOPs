\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\phi(b) = \phi_1 \bigg[(b + \phi_2)^{1-\gamma} - 1 \bigg] \\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

where $\phi_1$ measures the strength of bequest motivess and $\phi_2$ measures the extent to which bequests are luxury goods. When $\phi_2 > 0$, the marginal utility of small bequests is bounded.
