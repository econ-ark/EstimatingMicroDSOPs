/* Note: In the waves between 1995 and 2004, levels of normal income are reported. I interpret the level of normal income as being permanent income. Levels of normal income are not reported in the 1992 wave. Instead, in this wave there is a variable which reports whether the level of income is normal or not. Regarding the 1992 wave, only observations which report that the level of income is normal are used, and the levels of income of remaining observations in the 1992 wave are interpreted as the levels of permanent income. */
