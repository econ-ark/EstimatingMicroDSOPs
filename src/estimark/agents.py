"""Demonstrates an example estimation of microeconomic dynamic stochastic optimization
problem, as described in Section 9 of Chris Carroll's EstimatingMicroDSOPs.pdf notes.
The estimation attempts to match the age-conditional wealth profile of simulated
consumers to the median wealth holdings of seven age groups in the 2004 SCF by
varying only two parameters: the coefficient of relative risk aversion and a scaling
factor for an age-varying sequence of discount factors.  The estimation uses a
consumption-saving model with idiosyncratic shocks to permanent and transitory
income as defined in ConsIndShockModel.
